## What it does

This extension allows you to lookup up suttas or search SuttaCentral using the awesome bar.

To test it out, type 'sc' into the awesome bar followed by a search string (e.g. `cs almsbowl`). Hitting enter will search open the SuttaCentral.net search page for `almsbowl`.

Or type 'sc' and a citation or name of a sutta. suggestions will appear.
